# ‚ú® STELLARIS  
**Structured Textual Extraction & Linking for Live Analysis of Real-time Intelligence Sources**

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

STELLARIS is an AI-driven platform that ingests, processes, and analyzes **large volumes of unstructured text and relational data** from open sources such as news, social media, government releases, and intercepted communications. It extracts entities (people, places, organizations), detects relationships, and maps social or organizational networks.

By turning raw text and network data into rich, interactive knowledge graphs and actionable insights, STELLARIS empowers intelligence analysts and researchers to uncover hidden connections and assess complex situations efficiently.

---

## üéØ Vision & Goals

- **Unified Data Aggregation:** Seamlessly collect diverse textual and network intelligence from multiple real-time sources.  
- **Entity Recognition:** Automatically identify key entities including persons, organizations, locations, and dates within text.  
- **Relationship Mapping:** Build dynamic social and organizational graphs to visualize how entities interact and influence each other.  
- **Sentiment & Event Detection:** Analyze tone and detect emerging events or trends within streams of information.  
- **Interactive Knowledge Graphs:** Provide visual, drillable graphs to explore complex entity relationships over time.  
- **Advanced Search & Filtering:** Allow querying by entities, time frames, locations, and confidence scores.  
- **Collaborative Analysis:** Support annotation, tagging, and shared reporting workflows among analysts.  
- **APIs & Extensibility:** Provide RESTful endpoints for integration with external systems.  
- **Security & Compliance:** Encrypt data, enforce RBAC, and maintain audit logs for regulatory adherence.
